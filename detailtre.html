            <h2>What is Rickrolling?</h2>
            <p>Rickrolling is an internet meme and prank involving an unexpected appearance of the music video for "Never Gonna Give You Up," a 1987 hit song by British singer Rick Astley. The prank is often carried out by sharing a link that one would expect to be relevant to the topic at hand, which instead leads to Astley's music video.</p>
