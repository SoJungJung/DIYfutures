                <h3>T.B.E. (Not Decided Where and When)</h3>
                <p>
                    My family goes on vacation abroad in the summer. I'll be gone until late July - early August to
                    coincide with Dad's vacation or court recess.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The location is still under discussion, but Dubai, Greece, and the UK are among the current
                    candidates.
