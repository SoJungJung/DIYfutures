            <h2>During Workday</h2>
            <p>Usually, social service personnels do small tasks at work or have personal maintenance time, which I use to practice coding, programming, or sketching.</p>

            <h2>After Work</h2>
            <p>After work, instead of focusing on projects for the time being, I try to get in some exercise and build up my stamina. It's one of the things I learned at SAIC: fitness is creativity!</p>

            <h2>During Weekend</h2>
            <p>I don't know about over the weekend, the Department of Defense doesn't allow social service personnel to have jobs. Maybe they don't get weekends off?</p>
