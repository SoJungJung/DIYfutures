                <h2>During Workday</h2>
                <p>
                    Usually, social service personnels do small tasks at work or have personal maintenance time, which I
                    use to practice coding, programming, or sketching.
                </p>
                <p>My big brother is also a social service perosonnel.</p>
                <p>
                    He stands guard at the entrance of the Seoul Metropolitan Government's Nuclear Air Defense and
                    Disaster Response Center. No one is coming, no work is being done. The only things he does are
                    social media and reading books...
                </p>
                <p>I want to do what I'm asked to do, and then work on my career on my own time.</p>

                <h2>After Work</h2>
                <p>
                    After work, instead of focusing on projects for the time being, I try to get in some exercise and
                    build up my stamina. It's one of the things I learned at SAIC: fitness is creativity!

                <h2>Finanicial Plans</h2>
                <p>
                    South Korea's Ministry of Defense has partnered with banks to offer a savings product called the
                    "Soldier's Tomorrow Future Savings Account" to military personnel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soldier's Tomorrow Future Savings Account offers high interest rates (around 5% from the bank + 1%
                    from the government), a social rehabilitation reserve (71% of the principal), and tax-free benefits,
                    and I can expect to receive around $12,000 at maturity.
                </p>
                <p>I'll put in all the money I can put in.</p>
