                <h2>During Workday</h2>
                <p>
                    Usually, social service personnels do small tasks at work or have personal time, which I will use to
                    practice coding, programming, or sketching.
                </p>
                <p>My big brother is also a social service perosonnel.</p>
                <p>
                    He stands guard at the entrance of the Seoul Metropolitan Government's Nuclear Air Defense and
                    Disaster Response Center. No one is coming, no work is being done. The only things he does are
                    social media and reading books...
                </p>
                <p>I want to do what I'm asked to do, and then work on my career on my own time.</p>

                <h2>After Work</h2>
                <p>
                    After work, instead of focusing on art projects, I will try to get in some exercise and build up my
                    stamina. I'm interested in boxing and wrestling now. It's one of the things I learned at SAIC:
                    fitness is creativity!

                <h2>Finanicial Plans</h2>
                <p>
                    South Korea's Ministry of Defense has partnered with banks to offer a savings product called the
                    "Soldier's Tomorrow Future Savings Account" to military personnel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Soldier's Tomorrow Future Savings Account offers high interest rates (around 5% from the bank +
                    1% from the government), tax-free benefits, and when I finish my service, I can expect to receive
                    around $12,000 at maturity.
                </p>
                <p>I'll put in all the money I can put in.</p>
