                <p>
                    I did not research on internships that much. Why? I may not be here right after this or next
                    semester.

                <p>I made a handshake account. I am not sure my future bosses will like my portfolios.</p>
                <p>I want to get some help from CAPX after I come back.</p>

                <h3>Study Abroad</h3>
                <p>Ox-bow is not a bad option, but is not that fascinating option to me too.</p>
                <p>Ox-bow is too far away to go and live somewhere near there.</p>
                <p>Maybe study in different countries?</p>
                <p>I heard many art&tech students go on study trips to Germany.</p>
