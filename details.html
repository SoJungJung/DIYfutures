                <h2>What is Social Service Personnel?</h2>
                <p>
                    Social service personnel is an alternative service in government institutions necessary to fulfill
                    public purposes. All men in Korea have to serve in the military. Yes. I am that social service
                    personnel.

                <h2>How It Works. How Long It Takes.</h2>
                <p>
                    Social service personnel work for 21 months in public facilities, mainly in city halls, education
                    offices, courts, prosecutors' offices, police stations, national museums, national hospitals, and
                    schools for the disabled.

                <h2>What I Have To Do.</h2>
                <p>
                    The Military Services Administration and the Department of Defense consider social service personnel
                    to be civilians and do not interfere with them after the 9-6 workday.
                </p>
                <p>That means I can do whatever I want after hours.</p>
                <p>
                    Technically, it's illegal to have a paying job, but no one cares, nor does it matter. Just don't get
                    caught.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of social service personnel teach a tutoring class related to their college major, or take an
                    unpaid internship to gain experience.
