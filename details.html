                <h2>What I Have To Do?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Military Services Administration and the Department of Defense consider social service personnel
                    to be civilians and do not interfere with them after the 9-6 workday.

                <p>That means I can do whatever I want.</p>
                <p>
                    Technically, it's illegal to have a paying job, but no one cares, nor does it matter. Just don't get
                    caught.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of social service personnels teach a tutoring class related to their college major, or take an
                    unpaid internship to gain experience.
